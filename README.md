# Revise-App

* It is a revise app for students to revise important questions they have saved in the application's database . 
* It contains two sections one for DSA/CP questions and one for CS fundamental questions 
   ### DSA/CP:
    * For DSA/CP questions student can directly save the link of the question and add remarks and important points about the question and solution.
   ### CS Fundamentals:
    * int this student can decently write the question and remark or answer for the question. 
* I have added delete option also , if a student wants to remove some question from the applicaton he/she can delete it.
* I have also added TO-DO list feature in this app so that a student can keep tarck of what he/she needs to revise or do.


## Technology used:
* I have used node js and Express for backend and HTML,CSS and Javascript for frontend.

## Database :
* I have used MySQL database for storing and fetching data for the application.
